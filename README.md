# Password Generator Website

In this project, I wrote JavaScript code to generate a password based on user inputs.  Specifically, the user inputted the length of the password desired and the types of characters to be included in the password.  The site than used the code to generate random characters that confirmed to the user inputted constraints.     

## Specific Changes

The specific refactoring of the code included, without limitation, adding title information, adding accessibility information to the images, subsituting in semantic HTML elements where applicable, consolidating and organizing the CSS to shorten and simply the code, adding informative comments, repairing inoperable links, and re-sizing the main image, various fonts and certain margins to conform the live website to the client provided mockup.  

## Deployment

Horiseon's refactored website has been deloyed and can be accessed here: https://greenmanaustin.github.io/Horiseon-Refactor/

Here are three screenshots of the live website which have been roughly stitched together to give an approximation of how the website appears:

## Skills Learned

The process of refactoring is best accomplished by first taking the requisite time to learn the functionality of the existing code.  After that, and before making any changes to the code, outlining on paper all the changes that need to be made.  Finally, when making code changes, each change needs to be tested before proceeding to the next change.  There is a high risk of breaking the code with any given change so each change needs to be completed, including repairing any breaks in functionality, before proceeding to the next change.  Otherwise it may be difficult to ascertain what code change caused the break in functionality.
